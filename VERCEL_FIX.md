# How to Fix 404 Issues on Vercel Deployment

If you're experiencing 404 errors when accessing your Vercel-deployed Kids Slot Machine game, follow these steps to resolve the issue:

## Option 1: Quick Fix - Use the Base URL

The simplest solution is to use the base URL without `index.html`:

Instead of visiting: `https://kidslot.vercel.app/index.html`
Use: `https://kidslot.vercel.app/`

## Option 2: Fix Your Vercel Configuration

1. **Update your vercel.json file**:
   
   Make sure your vercel.json file contains the following:

   ```json
   {
     "version": 2,
     "rewrites": [
       { "source": "/index.html", "destination": "/" }
     ],
     "routes": [
       { "handle": "filesystem" },
       { "src": "/sounds/(.*)", "dest": "/sounds/$1" },
       { "src": "/(.*\\.(js|css|json|mp3|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico))", "dest": "/$1" },
       { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/index.html" }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Create a _redirects file**:

   If you're still having issues, create a file named `_redirects` (no file extension) in your project root with:

   ```
   /index.html              /              301
   /sounds/*                /sounds/:splat  200
   /*                       /index.html     200
   ```

3. **Add a 404.html file**:

   The 404.html file included in this project will automatically redirect users to the correct URL.

4. **Deploy a package.json file**:

   Make sure your project includes the package.json file from this project, which helps Vercel identify how to serve your application.

## Option 3: Use a Custom Vercel App Configuration

1. Rename `vercel.app.json` to `vercel.json`
2. Deploy your project again to Vercel

## Option 4: Manual Redirect Setup in Vercel Dashboard

1. Log in to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to "Settings" â†’ "Redirects"
4. Add a new redirect:
   - Source: `/index.html`
   - Destination: `/`
   - Status Code: 301
5. Save and redeploy

## Step-by-Step Deployment Instructions

1. Make sure you have the following files in your project:
   - `index.html`
   - `styles.css`
   - `script.js`
   - `vercel.json`
   - `404.html`
   - `_redirects`
   - `package.json`

2. Create a Vercel account if you don't have one

3. Install the Vercel CLI:
   ```
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

4. In your project directory, run:
   ```
   vercel
   ```

5. Follow the prompts to link your project

6. Once deployed, try accessing the root URL, not `/index.html`

## Still Having Issues?

If you're still experiencing problems, you can:

1. Try a different deployment platform like Netlify or GitHub Pages
2. Contact Vercel Support
3. Add a simple React framework to your project for better Vercel compatibility
