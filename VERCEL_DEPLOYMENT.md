# Simple Vercel Deployment Guide

Follow these steps to deploy the Kids Slot Machine game to Vercel.

## Deploy with Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Sign up or log in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

2. Click "New Project" in the Vercel dashboard

3. Import your Git repository or upload your files directly
   - If importing from Git, connect your GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket account
   - If uploading, drag and drop your project folder or use the file selection dialog

4. Configure project settings:
   - **Framework Preset**: "Other" or "Static Site"
   - **Build Command**: Leave empty
   - **Output Directory**: Leave empty
   - **Root Directory**: Leave as "/"

5. Click "Deploy"

## Deploy with Vercel CLI

Alternatively, you can use the Vercel CLI:

1. Install Vercel CLI:
   ```
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. In your project directory, run:
   ```
   vercel
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to complete deployment

## Important Notes

1. Access your deployed site at the URL provided by Vercel
   - Use the domain without adding `/index.html` (e.g., `https://kidslot.vercel.app/`)

2. Add sound files to your repository before deploying for the best experience:
   - `sounds/spin.mp3`
   - `sounds/win.mp3`
   - `sounds/background.mp3`

3. The game is designed to function even without sound files

## Troubleshooting

If your deployment fails:

1. Check that your project has the basic required files:
   - index.html
   - styles.css
   - script.js
   - simple vercel.json

2. Ensure no build errors by checking Vercel logs

3. Try deleting the project in Vercel and redeploying
