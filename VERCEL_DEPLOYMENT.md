# Deploying to Vercel

This document provides instructions for deploying the Kids Slot Machine game to Vercel.

## Preparation

1. Make sure all your files are properly committed to your Git repository.
2. Ensure you have the `vercel.json` configuration file in your project root.

## Deploying

### Option 1: Using the Vercel Dashboard

1. Create an account on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) if you don't have one
2. Go to the Vercel dashboard and click "New Project"
3. Import your repository from GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket
4. Configure your project settings:
   - Framework Preset: Other
   - Build Command: (leave empty)
   - Output Directory: (leave empty)
5. Click "Deploy"

### Option 2: Using the Vercel CLI

1. Install Vercel CLI:
   ```
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. Navigate to your project directory and run:
   ```
   vercel
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to configure and deploy your project

## Adding Sound Files

After deployment, you'll need to add sound files to make the game fully functional:

1. Go to your Vercel project settings
2. Navigate to "Storage" or use the Vercel CLI to upload files
3. Upload your sound files to the `/sounds` directory:
   - `spin.mp3`
   - `win.mp3`
   - `background.mp3`

Alternatively, you can add the sound files to your repository before deploying.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter a "Not Found" error:

1. Make sure all files are properly deployed
2. Check the browser console for any specific error messages
3. Verify that your `vercel.json` configuration is correct
4. Try deploying again with a clean installation

The application is designed to function even if sound files aren't available, but for the best experience, make sure to include them.
