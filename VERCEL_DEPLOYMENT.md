# Vercel Deployment Guide - Specific Instructions

## IMPORTANT: Follow these exact steps to deploy successfully

### Method 1: Deploy using the Vercel Web Interface

1. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and log in or create an account
2. Click "Add New..." â†’ "Project"
3. Import your Git repository or upload files directly
4. In the project configuration page:
   - Framework Preset: Select "Other"
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
   - Install Command: `npm install` (default)
5. Click "Deploy"

### Method 2: Deploy with Vercel CLI (Recommended)

1. Install Vercel CLI globally:
   ```
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. In your project directory, run:
   ```
   vercel
   ```

3. Answer the prompts:
   - Set up and deploy: Yes
   - Which scope: Select your account
   - Link to existing project: No
   - Project name: Enter your project name or accept default
   - Directory: ./ (current directory)
   - Override settings: Yes
   - Build Command: npm run build
   - Output Directory: dist
   - Development Command: npm start

### Method 3: Simple Deploy (Easiest)

If the above methods don't work, try this simplified approach:

1. In your project directory, run:
   ```
   npx vercel --prod
   ```

2. Keep the default settings but manually set:
   - Output Directory: dist

## Accessing Your Deployed Site

Always use the base URL provided by Vercel:
```
https://kidslot.vercel.app
```

Do NOT append `/index.html` to the URL.

## Troubleshooting 404 Errors

If you still get 404 errors:

1. Delete the project from your Vercel dashboard
2. Create a new project on Vercel
3. Try deploying again with Method 3 (Simple Deploy)
4. Check the Vercel logs for any specific errors

## Sound Files

For the full experience, add sound files to your repository:
- `sounds/spin.mp3` - A spinning sound effect
- `sounds/win.mp3` - A winning sound effect
- `sounds/background.mp3` - Background music

The game will still work without sound files.
