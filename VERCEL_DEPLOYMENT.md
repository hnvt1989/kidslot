# Simple Vercel Deployment Guide

## Manual Deploy (Recommended)

1. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and sign up/login
2. Click "Add New" â†’ "Project"
3. Choose "Upload" (instead of importing from Git)
4. Compress your project folder into a ZIP file:
   ```
   zip -r kidslot.zip index.html styles.css script.js sounds/
   ```
5. Drag and drop the ZIP file to Vercel
6. Configure as "Other" framework
7. Deploy without build settings

## CLI Deploy (Alternative)

For older Node.js versions, use this simpler approach:

1. First, install Vercel CLI globally:
   ```
   npm install -g vercel@latest
   ```

2. Then deploy:
   ```
   vercel deploy --prod
   ```

3. When prompted:
   - Set up and deploy: Yes
   - No build command
   - No output directory
   - No development command

## Access Your Site

Your site will be available at:
```
https://kidslot.vercel.app
```

## If You Still Get 404 Errors

1. Try manually uploading just the essential files:
   - index.html
   - styles.css
   - script.js
   - sounds folder (optional)

2. Ensure you're using the correct URL without `/index.html`

3. As a last resort, try a different hosting service like:
   - Netlify (drag and drop deployment)
   - GitHub Pages
   - Surge.sh (`npm install -g surge && surge`)
